# Custom VIM shortcuts (and useful reminders)

## [NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree)

+   `CTRL - e` opens NERDTree
+   `,e` and `,nt` open NERDTRee relative to current file (`NERDTreeFind`)

## [Vim Commentary](https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary)

+   `gcc` comments out line (or lines if number is provided)
+   `gc` same but takes a target block (or selection in visual mode)

## [Surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround)

+   `cs"'` replace surrounding `"` by `'
+   use `cst'` to replace a tag
+   `ds"` removes surroundinf `"`
+   `ys`works with text objects
+   in visual mode, use `S`

## [Abolish](https://github.com/tpope/vim-abolish)

Can do many things, but most useful for now are:
+   `crm` camel case
+   `crs` snake case
+   `cru` upper case
+   `crm` mixed case
